Messi
FooBar Challenge.
Messi is an Intelligent personal assistant that controls my entire
system through text, gestures and voice. Wrote a paper describing
how i optimised memory of a rule based bot.
DocSearch
Developed a more accurate document similarity algorithm for a
corpus of large documents using EMD over Latent Topics.
Sarah/Praktice/Elth
Sarah was a voice bot and praktice and elth were chatbots which I
developed for my work at Praktice.ai.
Clik.ai
Docu.ai is a search engine for querying over thousands of financial
documents which I developed for my time at Clik.ai.
Neural Networks API
Developing Hardware Abstraction Layer for Android’s Neural Networks
API.
